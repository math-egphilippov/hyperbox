Hyperbox is a symbolic execution virtual virtual machine for Waves RIDE smart-contracts, based on php, python and Z3Prover.
Demonstration version is available on http://2.59.42.98/hyperbox/
Architecture descripton: https://hsto.org/webt/jo/mj/5_/jomj5_tltmq3td9_r-xhyavhhqq.png

It mainly intended for formal verification and allows to find all existing vulnerabilities.

Hyperbox implements modern and powerful fully automatic multi-transactional search. For example, multi-transactional analysis support appeared in Mythril just recently:

Current version is 0.1, so syntax limited with
